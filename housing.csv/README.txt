Details of this Program:

This is a machine learning program which aims to calculate the likely prices of houses within the state of California based on key attributes and variables observed from the test data.
This is NOT to be used in order to set housing price estimates in the real world, as there are multiple variables which exist in the real world that can affect house pricing which is not included in the dataset.
To ensure the Jupyter notebook runs correctly, kindly download all files within the GitHub repository and place them in the same directory in your laptop/device.
