Important:

This program is a code which aims to predict the survival probabilities of those embarking on the Titanic. 
The datasets used for the program are located within the repository folder, and these calculations and predictions are based solely off this.
This program is not for commercial usage, and is not advised for usage in order to predict odds of survival (after all, you weren't alive when the Titanic embarked in 1914.)
To access the code and ensure it works properly, kindly make sure all the files in the GitHub are downloaded and placed in the same directory in your computer.
